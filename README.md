# Hierarchy explorer 

Visualizing a hierarchy with an expandable/collapsable tree.

## Implementation
This approach is based on [this codepen by Brendan Dougan](https://codepen.io/brendandougan/pen/PpEzRp) and is implemented with [d3-template](https://github.com/EE2dev/d3-template) as a reusable d3 chart.

## to do
[ok] convert tree to reusable
[ok] read json file
* selectio.each() ?
* support csv file and inline csv file
* all nodes with square + cross when collapsed
* -| when expanded
* square when leaf
* API call to initiate tree with collapsed nodes [node2, node7]
* create nodes from names as ids and from separate ids if names are ambiguuous

* color
* thickness
* zoom
* mouseover -> tooltip (with little diagram)
* additional info (quatity) right aligned
* allow grafics before text for each node
