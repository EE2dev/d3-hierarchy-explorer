# Hierarchy explorer 

Visualizing a hierarchy with an expandable/collapsable tree.

## Implementation
This approach is based on [this bl.ock from Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1093025) and [this codepen by Brendan Dougan](https://codepen.io/brendandougan/pen/PpEzRp) and is implemented with [d3-template](https://github.com/EE2dev/d3-template) as a reusable d3 chart.
