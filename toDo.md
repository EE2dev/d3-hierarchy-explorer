[ok] convert tree to reusable
[ok] read json file

* dynamic linkWidth
* selectio.each() ?
* support csv file and inline csv file
* all nodes with square + cross when collapsed
* -| when expanded
* square when leaf
* API call to initiate tree with collapsed nodes [node2, node7] --> collapse
* create nodes from names as ids and from separate ids if names are ambiguuous
* updateFunction for maxNameLength
* tree with no interior nodes + text on top of nodes (not leaves)
